/**
 * ScopeBadge Component
 *
 * Marks whether a wizard section wants ONE combined household figure or a per-person one.
 * Render it only for married-filing-jointly plans — for a single filer the distinction is
 * noise.
 *
 * Presentational only, but the scope it names has to match what the engine actually does:
 * accounts are pooled into one household balance, healthcare cost inputs are per-person
 * amounts applied to each spouse's own Medicare timeline and summed, and part-time work is
 * modeled as YOUR earnings alone (it feeds your Social Security earnings test, and a
 * spouse's own work isn't modeled). See `docs/4-married-filing-jointly.md`.
 *
 * @example
 * {isMFJ && <ScopeBadge scope="household" />}
