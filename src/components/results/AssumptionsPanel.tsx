                            Your primary residence is typically NOT included as a liquid retirement asset because
                            you need somewhere to live — by default, just leave it out of your plan.

                            If you plan to downsize, model it directly: add a One-Time Expense in Step 1 for moving
                            costs at your planned sale age, add the net sale proceeds to your Taxable Account
                            balance, and lower your spending afterward to reflect the smaller home.

                            brokerage account. Set its expected return to your account's interest rate (e.g., 4–5%)
                            instead of a market return.

                            One gap to know: this tool taxes taxable-account growth only when withdrawn, not
                            annually. Real HYSA interest is taxed as ordinary income every year it's earned, so a
                            large cash balance will owe slightly more real-world tax than this model shows.
